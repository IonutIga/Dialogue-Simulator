# Dialogue-Simulator
 Our approach aims to bootstrap the development of a conversational agent by generating a dataset that contains an arbitrary number of dialogues for training any neural network of oneâ€™s choice. We build a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) system, with three main components: a prompt generator, a user simulator, and a task-oriented dialogue system (TODS).
